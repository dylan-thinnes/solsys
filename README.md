# [SolSys](http://solsys.me)
SolSys is an art / programming project that uses the fact that any given integer can be represented as a set of prime factors to turn numbers and equations into unique, recursively defined prime numbers.

By using existing prime factorization libraries such as primecount and msieve, the server-side prime factorization can handle numbers in ranges as high as 50 digits in under a second, even on low-end processors.
